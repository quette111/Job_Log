## Description
**JobLog** is a web application that helps users track their job applications. Users can enter job details, including:
- Job Title
- Company Name
- Job Status (Applied, Interested, Closed, Assessment, Rejected, Interview)

Once added, the app displays job entries as cards, incorporating the **logo.dev API** to fetch and display company logos dynamically. Additionally, **GraphQL** is used to visualize job application statuses in graphs, allowing users to track their progress at a glance.

This project is currently a **work in progress**.
